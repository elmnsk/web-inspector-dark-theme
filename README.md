WebKit Inspector Dark Theme
===========================
*by Nicolas Artman*


This is a work in progress full reskin of the chrome/safari web inspector, geared to be easy on your eyes during those late night coding binges! It's also designed to be less distracting when you're in the zone, so you can focus on the important things - like the code, properties/debugger, and console.

Here are some pictures of the current version:
