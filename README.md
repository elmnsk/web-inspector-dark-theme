WebKit Inspector Dark Theme
===========================
*by Nicolas Artman*


This is a work in progress full reskin of the chrome/safari web inspector, geared to be easy on your eyes during those late night coding binges! It's also designed to be less distracting when you're in the zone, so you can focus on the important things - like the code, properties/debugger, and console.

Here are some pictures of the current version:

As one can see, there are still plenty of tweaks to be made, but the elements, scripts, and console tabs should be good enough for daily use (in fact, I use this theme for almost all my development).

Also, yes, I realize the text size is far too big for most people. I have poor eyesight. I'm working on centralizing the text sizing so others can easily adjust it to their liking.
